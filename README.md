### RDR3-Crash-Diagnostics
-------
This is a simple tool written to help diagnose underlying issues with Red Dead Redemption 2 (rdr3) mods and scripts. This was originally written to help diagnose issues with ScriptHookRDR2DotNet not working for some users with no indication as to why.

The information this tool collects is as follows:
- Collects a list of file names in your game directory
- Collects a list of file names in your script directory
- Collects all *.log files in your game directory
- Collects your current game version
- Runs DirectX Diagnostics tool

All information collected is put into a zip file which must manually be uploaded by the user. This allows users to fully control what information is given to the developers requesting this dump.

The goal of this tool is to provide developers an easy way to diagnose underlying issues which are not readily apparent in the log files.
